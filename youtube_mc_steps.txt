Prompt 02
The Modules

Now that you have the foundation, add power modules. Each prompt adds a new tab to your existing dashboard.

💡 How to use: Open a new conversation with your AI. Paste your existing mission-control.html file first, then paste the module prompt below it. The AI will return an updated file with the new tab integrated.
💰 Module A: Revenue Tracker
Track MRR, manage clients, visualize growth, and project annual revenue.
Add a 💰 Revenue tab to my Mission Control. Include:
- Monthly revenue goal with visual gauge (circular or bar)
- Revenue chart showing last 6 months (simple bar chart, CSS-only or canvas)
- Client list with: name, monthly value, status (active/pending/churned), start date
- Add/edit/remove clients, auto-calculate MRR
- Revenue projections section: if current MRR continues, show projected annual + monthly growth needed to hit goal
- All data in localStorage
- Match the existing dark glassmorphism theme and animation style
🏢 Module B: AI Agent Command Center
Manage your AI agents, track their activity, send tasks, and log executive decisions.
Add a 🏢 Command Center tab to my Mission Control for managing my AI agents/team. Include:
- Agent cards in a grid: each shows name, role/title, status (online/busy/offline with colored dots), model being used, last active timestamp
- Click agent card to open a slide-out detail panel with: full description, capabilities list, recent activity log, performance notes
- "Send Task" button that opens a modal with a text area (simulates sending tasks — saves to agent's activity log)
- Executive Decisions section below agents: list of key decisions made with date, question asked, decision summary, which agents were consulted
- Store all agent data in localStorage, include 3-4 sample agents to start
🎬 Module C: YouTube Studio
Plan video content, track growth milestones, and manage a content calendar.
Add a 🎬 YouTube tab to my Mission Control for planning video content. Include:
- Video ideas pipeline: cards with title, topic, status (idea/scripting/filming/editing/published), target publish date
- Add/edit ideas, move between statuses
- YouTube growth tracker: current sub count (editable), milestone levels with fun titles (e.g., "Rising Creator" at 1K, "Growth Engine" at 10K), XP-style progress bar to next milestone
- Content calendar: simple month grid showing planned publish dates
- All data in localStorage, match existing theme
📞 Module D: Meeting Prep
Never walk into a meeting unprepared. Track agendas, notes, and action items.
Add a 📞 Meetings tab to my Mission Control. Include:
- Upcoming meetings list: title, date/time, attendee(s), type (call/zoom/in-person), prep notes
- Add/edit/delete meetings
- Each meeting card expands to show: agenda items (editable checklist), notes textarea, action items that come out of it
- Past meetings archive (auto-moves when date passes)
- Today's meetings highlighted at top with countdown timers
- localStorage persistence, match theme
📡 Module E: Daily Intel Feed
Curate your own intel feed — AI news, trends, competitor moves, and opportunities.
Add a 📡 Intel tab to my Mission Control. Include:
- Sections for different intel categories: AI News, Industry Trends, Competitor Watch, Opportunities
- Each item: title, summary, source link, date added, importance tag (🔥 hot / ⚡ notable / 📌 reference)
- Add new intel items with a simple form
- Filter by category and importance
- "Daily Brief" section at top: 3-5 most important items auto-sorted by date
- localStorage persistence, match theme
Prompt 03
The Engine

Make Mission Control a living dashboard. This prompt builds a lightweight Node.js server for live data, weather, and backup.
📋 Complete Prompt
I need a lightweight local server to power my Mission Control dashboard with live data. Build me a complete Node.js server with these specs:

Setup:
- Single file: server.js (or server.mjs)
- Port: 8899
- Serve my mission-control.html file at the root
- CORS enabled for local development
- No heavy frameworks — just built-in Node http/https modules (or Express if cleaner)

API Endpoints:
Create RESTful endpoints that Mission Control can fetch from:

1. GET /mc/status — Returns system status:
   - Server uptime, last data refresh timestamp, connection health: "online"

2. GET /mc/data — Returns dashboard data:
   - Read from a local JSON file (mc-data.json) that stores all dashboard state

3. POST /mc/data — Save dashboard data:
   - Accepts JSON body, writes to mc-data.json
   - Lets Mission Control sync its localStorage to the server as backup

4. GET /mc/weather?city=[CITY] — Fetch current weather:
   - Use wttr.in API (free, no key): https://wttr.in/[CITY]?format=j1
   - Return: temperature, condition, feels_like

5. GET /mc/activity — Returns recent activity log:
   - Read from mc-activity.json, returns last 50 entries

6. POST /mc/activity — Add activity entry:
   - Appends to mc-activity.json with timestamp

Auto-start (macOS):
Also generate a LaunchAgent plist file that auto-starts this server on login:
- File: ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.missioncontrol.server.plist
- Points to the server.js file
- Runs on load, restarts if crashed
- Include the terminal commands to install it

Setup instructions:
Print clear step-by-step setup instructions:
1. Save server.js to a folder
2. Run `node server.js`
3. Open http://localhost:8899
4. (Optional) Install the LaunchAgent for auto-start

Keep it simple. No database, no auth, no complexity. Just a clean local server that makes Mission Control come alive.
Prompt 03 — Bonus
Connecting Your Dashboard to the Server

Once your server is running, use this mini-prompt to wire up your dashboard:
⚡ Connection Prompt
Update my mission-control.html to connect to the local server at http://localhost:8899. Add:

1. On page load, fetch GET /mc/data and merge with localStorage (server = backup, localStorage = primary)
2. Every 5 minutes, POST current localStorage state to /mc/data as backup
3. Fetch weather from GET /mc/weather?city=[YOUR_CITY] and display temp + condition in the header next to the status dot
4. When any data changes, POST to /mc/activity with a description of what changed
5. Update the status dot: green = server connected, red = offline (fallback to localStorage-only mode)
6. Add a small "Server: Online/Offline" indicator in the header

Keep all existing localStorage functionality as the primary data layer. The server is a backup + data enrichment layer, not a replacement.

💡 Pro tip: You don't need The Engine to use Mission Control. The HTML file works perfectly standalone. The server just adds superpowers — live weather, backup, and a clean localhost URL.
