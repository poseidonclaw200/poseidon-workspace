# 2026-02-20 (Denver) - Memory System Improvements

## Memory Timezone Standardization

**Fixed timezone confusion:**
- Memory files now use America/Denver dates (not UTC)
- Previous files (2026-02-15 through 2026-02-19) used UTC dates - kept as-is for historical record
- Going forward: all `memory/YYYY-MM-DD.md` files use Denver dates

**Rationale:**
- "Yesterday's work" should match Riley's perception (Denver time)
- System logs stay in UTC for server management
- Conversational context uses Denver time

## Today's Activity

- Gateway configuration discussion (multi-provider model routing proposal)
- Security questions about port 58762 and postgres user
- Discovered missing PostgreSQL migration documentation in 2026-02-19.md memory
- Updated 2026-02-19.md to properly document PostgreSQL 17 migration for MissionControl

## Outstanding Work

- MissionControl has uncommitted changes (settings.py, base.jinja2, new static/ dir)
- Gateway multi-provider config still under review
- Need API keys for OpenAI, DeepSeek, Google if we proceed with that config
