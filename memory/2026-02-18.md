## CurtisDynamics — Big Day

Heavy push on CurtisDynamics. Three Poseidon commits + one Riley migration commit.

### What was built:
1. **UI overhaul** — warm light mode, system dark mode (Tailwind media), hero gradient with blur blobs, eyebrow labels, polished inputs
2. **Icon hover cleanup** — ported group-hover effects to home.jinja2, deleted stale index.jinja2
3. **Client portal dashboard** — the big one:
   - Models: ClientProfile, Project, Appointment, Invoice
   - Full admin config with fieldsets, inlines (Invoice inside Project), collapsible sections
   - Views: /dashboard/ (overview), /projects/, /appointments/, /payments/, login, logout
   - Jinja2 templates: sticky sidebar desktop, bottom tab bar mobile, full dark mode

### Commits (CurtisDynamics):
- 7f3a647 — UI: warm light mode + system dark mode support
- bd36861 — Port icon hover effect from index.jinja2, delete index.jinja2
- f168c52 — Add client portal dashboard

## Token Cost Optimizations (Evening)

Riley asked to implement all 3 token reduction recommendations from analysis.

### Changes Applied:
1. **Heartbeat interval: 30m → 60m** — cuts heartbeat token cost ~50%
   - Added active hours: 7 AM–11 PM Denver (no more 3 AM pings)
   - Config patched via `gateway(action="config.patch")`
2. **daily-work-summary rescheduled: 11:50 PM → 5:50 AM Denver**
   - Now runs 10 min before Daily Summary Report (6 AM)
   - Cron job updated via `cron(action="update", jobId="37f34756-eb44-4165-8f9e-532b020e0f9b")`
3. **Compaction mode verified: already `safeguard`** — handles context growth automatically, no change needed

### Impact:
- **Before:** 48 heartbeat polls/day @ 30-min intervals, each loading 85k+ tokens
- **After:** ~32 polls/day during active hours (7 AM–11 PM), 60-min intervals
- **Expected savings:** ~33% reduction in daily token usage (heartbeats were largest cost driver)

Gateway restarted to apply heartbeat config change.
