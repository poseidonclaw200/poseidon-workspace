## VPS Security Hardening - Complete

Ran comprehensive security audit and hardening with Riley. System is now in **VPS Hardened** posture.

### Actions Taken

**Firewall Installation & Configuration:**
- Installed `ufw` (Uncomplicated Firewall)
- Configured deny-by-default inbound policy
- Allowed SSH only from Tailscale network (100.64.0.0/10)
- Allowed loopback traffic (127.0.0.0/8) for OpenClaw gateway
- Enabled and verified firewall active

**OpenClaw Config Cleanup:**
- Removed invalid `gateway.nodes.denyCommands` entries (camera.snap, camera.clip, etc.)
- Reduced warnings from 3 → 2 (only cosmetic issues remain)

**Periodic Monitoring Setup:**
- **Daily security audit:** 6:00 AM Denver time
  - Runs `openclaw security audit --deep`
  - Logs to `/home/poseidon/.openclaw/security-logs/audit-YYYY-MM-DD.log`
  - Notifies via Telegram if issues found
- **Weekly update check:** Sundays at 8:00 PM Denver time
  - Runs `openclaw update status`
  - Notifies via Telegram if updates available

### Security Posture Achieved

✅ **Complete:**
- Firewall: Active, deny-by-default inbound
- SSH: Key-only, no root login, Tailscale-only access
- Auto-updates: Enabled (unattended-upgrades)
- Disk encryption: Hostinger-managed
- OpenClaw: Loopback-bound (127.0.0.1:18789)
- Attack surface: Minimal (SSH via Tailscale only)
- Monitoring: Automated daily audits + weekly update checks

### Key Commands Used

```bash
# Firewall setup
sudo apt install -y ufw
sudo ufw default deny incoming
sudo ufw default allow outgoing
sudo ufw allow from 100.64.0.0/10 to any port 22 proto tcp comment 'SSH via Tailscale'
sudo ufw allow from 127.0.0.0/8 comment 'Loopback'
sudo ufw --force enable

# Verification
sudo ufw status verbose
openclaw security audit --deep
```

### Cron Jobs Created

- `healthcheck:security-audit` (daily at 6 AM)
- `healthcheck:update-status` (Sundays at 8 PM)

### Notes

- Current SSH access via Tailscale confirmed working after firewall activation
- Hostinger console available as emergency backup access
- Model switched to Sonnet for security analysis (more capable than Haiku)
- All changes approved step-by-step by Riley
