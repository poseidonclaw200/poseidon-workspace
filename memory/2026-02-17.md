## MissionControl Project

**Purpose:** Central hub to track work and plan projects together

**Tech Stack:** Django app (Python)
- Location: `~/Projects/MissionControl` on VPS
- Database: SQLite (db.sqlite3)
- Git tracked with changes from Feb 16-17
- Riley debugged and made corrections on his home computer

**Visibility:** Changes made on Riley's home computer to this directory are visible to me on the VPS (same repo, synced via git/shared access)

**Ongoing:** This is a continuous project that we'll iterate on to make better over time.
