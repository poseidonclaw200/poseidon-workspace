## Preferences Discovery
- Riley explicitly said he prefers step-by-step walkthroughs with command-line instructions so he can learn by doing; wants future help in that style
- This is a key insight for all future technical assistance — prioritize teaching over doing

## Mission Control Dashboard Project
- Created comprehensive mega-prompt guide for building a personal command center dashboard
- **File:** `youtube_mc_steps.txt` (detailed walkthrough with 3 progressive prompts)
- **Concept:** Single-file HTML dashboard with dark glassmorphism theme, localStorage persistence
- **Modules planned:** Foundation (core dashboard), Revenue Tracker, AI Agent Command Center, YouTube Studio, Meeting Prep, Daily Intel Feed, and optional Node.js backend ("The Engine")
- Generated UI mockup using OpenAI image generation to visualize the dark glassmorph aesthetic
- **Context:** Riley exploring ways to build personal productivity dashboards with AI assistance
